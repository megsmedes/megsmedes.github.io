      <H1>Making Tea From the Garden</H1>
        <H2>Making Tea is Fun and Easy</H2>
        <p>I love tea!  I buy it from the store for so many things!  
        I like green tea for immunity and caffeine and I like herbal 
        teas for flavor and health.  For example, I love a good sleep 
        tea to ease headaches and to relax. I like lemon tea for sore 
        throats and ginger tea for stomach aches. </p>
        <p>It ocurred to me recently that I can make my own tea using 
        plants in my yard. I have a yard that is about 85% 
        native-to-Colorado plants and 15% non-native. I've always known 
        that these plants have historic uses by the indigenous people and 
        by those who brought plants from around the world  However, 
        except for the occsional nibble of a berry along a hikng trail, 
        I've rarely used them myself, until now.  Below, I share how I 
        preserved herbs from my yard to use as tea.</p>
