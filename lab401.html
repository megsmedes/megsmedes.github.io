      <H1>Making Tea From the Garden</H1>
        <H2>Tea in my own Yard</H2>
          <p>I love to drink tea!  I buy it from the store for so many things.  
        I like green tea for immunity and caffeine. I like herbal 
        teas for flavor and health.  For example, I love a good sleep 
        tea to ease headaches and to relax. I like lemon tea for sore 
        throats and ginger tea for stomach aches. </p>
          <p>It ocurred to me recently that I can make my own tea using 
        plants in my yard. I have a yard that is about 85% 
        native-to-Colorado plants and 15% non-native. I've always known 
        that these plants have historic uses by the indigenous people of my area and 
        by those who brought plants here from around the world.  However, 
        except for the occasional nibble of a berry along a hikng trail, 
        I've rarely used these plants myself, until now.  </p>
